### Hey, I'm Hanno!

I'm a self-employed maker and software developer from the [Odenwald](https://hanno.braun-odw.eu/made-in-odenwald/2.jpg) region in Germany. I maintain a bunch of repositories in the Embedded Rust space, I work on an [experimental CAD system](https://github.com/hannobraun/fornjot), and I write about [making, automation and small-scale manufacturing](https://hanno.braun-odw.eu/) topics on my website.

Please [reach out](https://hanno.braun-odw.eu/contact), if you're interested in any of that. I'd love to talk!
