### Hey, I'm Hanno!

I work on [**Fornjot**](https://github.com/hannobraun/fornjot), an early-stage b-rep CAD kernel, written in Rust. Please [**support me**](https://github.com/sponsors/hannobraun), if you think that's worthwhile!

Other than that, I'm a self-employed software developer and maker from the [Odenwald](https://hanno.braun-odw.eu/made-in-odenwald/2.jpg) region in Germany. Please [reach out](https://hanno.braun-odw.eu/contact), if you're interested in anything I'm doing. I'd love to talk!
