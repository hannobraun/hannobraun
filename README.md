### Hey, I'm Hanno!

I'm a self-employed software developer from the [Odenwald](https://madeby.hannobraun.de/made-in-odenwald/2.jpg) region in Germany. My focus is writing **microcontroller firmware** in Rust. You can [hire me](https://braun-embedded.com/), if you need someone to help you with that.
