### Hey, I'm Hanno!

I'm a self-employed software developer from the [Odenwald](https://madeby.hannobraun.de/made-in-odenwald/2.jpg) region in Germany. My focus is writing **microcontroller firmware**, specifically in the field of **motion control**. You can [hire me](https://braun-embedded.com/), if you need someone to help you with that.

I work on **[Flott](https://flott-motion.org/)**, the toolkit for motion control software in Rust. If you like Flott and want to support its development, please consider [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/hannobraun)!
