### Hey, I'm Hanno!

[**The world needs another CAD program**](https://github.com/sponsors/hannobraun), and I'm building it. If you're also interested in CAD software, check out [**Fornjot**](https://github.com/hannobraun/Fornjot), the project I'm working on.

Other than that, I'm a self-employed software developer and maker from the [Odenwald](https://hanno.braun-odw.eu/made-in-odenwald/2.jpg) region in Germany. I write about CAD, product development, and general workshop stuff [over at my website](https://hanno.braun-odw.eu/).

Please [reach out](https://hanno.braun-odw.eu/contact), if you're interested in any of that. I'd love to talk!
